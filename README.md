# Computational-Intelligence-Project
In this repository, I have uploaded an AI Matlab based project for our Computational Intelligence course, for which we had to study a paper and improve the results based on our own skills and a combination of some algorithms mentioned in the paper.
	paper name: EEG-based emotion recognition in an immersive virtual reality
	environment: From local activity to brain network features
	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809421009460?via%3Dihub

 	I am proud to announce that I achieved an accuracy of 76.4%, nearly a 4% improvement compared to the mentioned paper.
  	I have also added some screenshots from the step by step results.
   	Unfortunately, since the database was almost 1GB in size, I could upload the datasets. You can use this code to classify another related database by just changing the input file names.
