# Computational-Intelligence-Project
In this repository, I have uploaded an AI Matlab based project for our Computational Intelligence course, for which we had to study a paper and improve the results based on our own skills and a combination of some algorithms mentioned in the paper.
	paper name: EEG-based emotion recognition in an immersive virtual reality
	environment: From local activity to brain network features
